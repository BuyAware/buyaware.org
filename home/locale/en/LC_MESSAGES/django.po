"\t  We are a group of young students from different regions of Switzerland "
"who met at the Swiss Talent Forum in 2015. It was here that we initiated the "
"BuyAware project, and have been developing the idea ever since.\n"
"\t</p>\n"
"\t<p>\n"
"\t  It is our goal to inform consumers about the ecological and ethical "
"background of different products in the electronics sector, so that the "
"consumers can make a more responsible purchase decision. In order to do so "
"we assess the devices according to six categories: climate and energy, "
"ecology, worker rights, conflict minerals, transparency of the company and "
"performance. The results of these assessments are then merged to form the "
"product profile which our users can access over our database and use for "
"comparison purposes. It is important to us that we present our assessments "
"in an all-in-one format so that our customers can immediately see where a "
"product has its strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, we understand that "
"different people have different needs, which is why the weightings of our "
"six assessed categories can be adjusted individually, so that we are able to "
"give the most helpful feedback possible.\n"
"\t</p>\n"
"\t<p>\n"
"\t  At the moment, we focus our activities only on smartphones. In the long "
"run however, we are planning on expanding our service to cover all products "
"in the electronics sector.\n"
