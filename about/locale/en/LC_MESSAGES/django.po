"\t   We are a group of young students from different regions of Switzerland "
"who met at the Swiss Talent Forum in 2015. It was here that we initiated the "
"BuyAware project, and have been developing the idea ever since.\n"
"\t  </p>\n"
"\t  <p>\n"
"It is our goal to inform consumers about the ecological and ethical "
"background of different products in of the electronics sector, so that the "
"consumers can make a more responsible purchase decision. In order to do so "
"we assess the devices according to six categories: climate and energy, "
"ecology, worker rights, conflict minerals, transparency of the company and "
"performance. The results of these assessments are then merged to form the "
"product profile which our users can access over our database and use for "
"comparison purposes. It is important to us that we present our assessments "
"in an all-in-one format so that our customers can immediately see where a "
"product has its strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, we understand that "
"different people have different needs, which is why the weightings of our "
"six assessed categories can be adjusted individually, so that we are able to "
"give the most helpful feedback possible.\n"
"\t  </p>\n"
"\t  <p>\n"
"At the moment, we focus our activities only on smartphones. In the long run "
"however, we are planning on expanding our service to cover all products in "
"the electronics sector.\n"

"BuyAware first came up at the Swiss Talent Forum, a think tank organized by "
"Swiss Youth in Science. One group had the task of finding a new policy "
"related to technology and ecology that will influence smart and sustainable "
"progress in the next 10 years. They decided to design a government funded, "

"fairness of her/his consumption behavior through alerts in a smartphone "

" We evaluate the products according to six categories: climate and energy, "
"ecology, worker rights, conflict minerals, transparency of the company and "
"performance. Each of these categories contains several criteria which we "
"have to analyse during our assessments. One has to discriminate between two "
"different types of criteria:\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"  <ul>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"      Yes/No-questions: asking for example if a product contains a specific "
"toxic substance or if the company analyses and publishes its annual CO2-"
"footprint. With this criteria type only two results are possible: The point "
"is given if the answer meets expectations, otherwise it is not. \n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"      Questions on a linear scale asking for example how big the CO2-"
"footprint of the product is or how much e-waste the company recycles. With "
"this kind of criteria we first have to define an upper and lower threshold; "
"for instance 20 kg CO2 and 100 kg CO2 for the CO2-footprint-criteria. In "
"this case the product would get the full point if it has a CO2-footprint of "
"20 kg and less, zero points for 100 kg and more. For values lying between "
"the two thresholds we operate on a linear scale meaning that 40 kg CO2 would "
"result in 0.8 points and so on.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"  </ul>\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"  In situations where we are not able to find any suitable information the "
"product gets zero points. In very few cases the information available does "
"not completely relate to the criteria. Then, we are forced to interpret the "
"data to the best of our ability. If a product performs particularly well we "
"assign bonus points.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"  It is important to us that our users can understand our assessments in "
"every detail. That is why there is a short comment and a link to our source "
"for every single criteria of the analyses.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"  As soon as all 48 criteria of our list have been assessed six category "
"scores are calculated. It is relevant to know that not all criteria of a "
"category are weighted equally. For instance, the five questions about the "
"presence of certain toxic substances are all weighted a lot less than the "
"criteria asking about the degree of recycling of the company.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"  The results of all six categories are then summarised in our spiderweb "
"product profiles and the total score is calculated.\n"

"<p>\n"
"  We live in times of unrestricted mass consumption. Nowadays, it is "
"possible for people to buy anything, at any time, from any place and get it "
"delivered to our doorstep. Shoes from Thailand, coffee from Brazil or a "
"mobile phone from China, the choice is endless. Even though globalisation "
"has undoubtedly led to many advantages, we also face some severe problems "
"nowadays which were created by this process: for example climate change; "
"depletion of resources and pollution of the environment.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
" Additionally, global market access has led to depersonalisation. In other "
"words: We do not really know what it is we are about to buy eg. if the "
"product is of high quality or if it might still contain some toxic "
"substances. In the food and clothing industries several organisations have "
"made attempts to counteract this development by introducing informative "
"labels like Organic, Fairtrade, FSC, etc. So far these have only had limited "
"success. One criticism that consumers often raise regarding labelling is "
"that too many labels already exist, which cause confusion.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"A sector that has been mostly unlabelled so far is the electronics industry. "
"In our opinion this is because electronic devices are a lot more complex "
"than for example a banana or a t-shirt. Therefore, one has to take more "
"factors into account when assessing these products. For us at BuyAware, this "
"is not a legitimate reason to give up. In fact, the exact opposite is the "
"case: We believe that exactly in areas where the degree of complexity is "
"high, it is necessary to inform the consumer about the background of the "
"products. Also, we try to learn from the mistakes which have been made in "
"other industries in the past. That is why it is our goal to make complete "
"assessments which take all relevant factors into account and are then "
"presented in a simple format. It should be possible to view all relevant "
"information at a glance. \n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"We believe that the time has come to confront unrestricted mass consumption "
"in a critical manner. Make your contribution to the global turnaround by "
"supporting BuyAware!\n"
