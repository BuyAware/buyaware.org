"BuyAware first came up at the Swiss Talent Forum, a think tank organized by "
"Swiss Youth in Science. One group had the task of finding a new policy "
"related to technology and ecology that will influence smart and sustainable "
"progress in the next 10 years. They decided to design a government funded, "
"NGO coordinated database that gives the consumer feedback on the ecology and "
"fairness of her/his consumption behavior through alerts in a smartphone "
"application. They chose to name the idea BuyAware."

" We evaluate the products according to six categories: climate and energy, "

"20 kg CO2 and 100 kg CO2 for the CO2-footprint-criteria. In this case the "
"product would get the full point if it has a CO2-footprint of 20 kg and "

"  We live in times of unrestricted mass consumption. Nowadays, it is "
"possible for people to buy anything, at any time, from any place and get it "
"delivered to our doorstep. Shoes from Thailand, coffee from Brazil or a "
"mobile phone from China, the choice is endless. Even though globalisation "
"has undoubtedly led to many advantages, we also face some severe problems "
"nowadays which were created by this process: for example climate change; "
"depletion of resources and pollution of the environment.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
" Additionally, global market access has led to depersonalisation. In other "
"words: We do not really know what it is we are about to buy eg. if the "
"product is of high quality or if it might still contain some toxic "
"substances. In the food and clothing industries several organisations have "
"made attempts to counteract this development by introducing informative "
"labels like Organic, Fairtrade, FSC, etc. So far these have only had limited "
"success. One criticism that consumers often raise regarding labelling is "
"that too many labels already exist, which cause confusion.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"A sector that has been mostly unlabelled so far is the electronics industry. "
"In our opinion this is because electronic devices are a lot more complex "
"than for example a banana or a t-shirt. Therefore, one has to take more "
"factors into account when assessing these products. For us at BuyAware, this "
"is not a legitimate reason to give up. In fact, the exact opposite is the "
"case: We believe that exactly in areas where the degree of complexity is "
"high, it is necessary to inform the consumer about the background of the "
"products. Also, we try to learn from the mistakes which have been made in "
"other industries in the past. That is why it is our goal to make complete "
"assessments which take all relevant factors into account and are then "
"presented in a simple format. It should be possible to view all relevant "
"information at a glance. \n"

"We believe that the time has come to confront unrestricted mass consumption "
"in a critical manner. Make your contribution to the global turnaround by "
